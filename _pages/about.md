I'm a CS+Chemistry undergrad from BITS Goa '22. Intrested in programming and building things from scratch. Currently exploring extremely wide fields in CS, ranging from Back-end development in Django to A* search algorithms using heuristics. Currently working for Practice School Division as a freelance backend developer. Previously interned in North Eastern Space Application Centre (Umiam) where I worked alongside a team to deploy ML models written in python with Django as the backend. Joining Intuit as a SDE intern in May 2021! 

[Reverie](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie) is a Jekyll theme which is simple and opinionated. It's actually a fork of [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) with some additional features and personal touches which I've implemented to suit my needs for my blog.
